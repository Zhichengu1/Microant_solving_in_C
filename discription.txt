(Virtual Ant) – a text based ant

Ant has its own memory implemented as a stack of size MAX_SIZE and with the operators
(functions) like those: pop, push, peek, clear, empty, and full. Each stack element
can store the current physical position of the ant inside the maze. The physical position is
described as the pair x,y. The positions are indicated by 2 integer numbers, x and y, but the
accurate position is not displayed to the Ant. So, the Ant does not know the map coordinates of
the place it must navigate and it does not know its current position coordinates or any of its
previous positions’ coordinates. The following implemention will be in C  programming language.

To avoid linker issue compile the following commands:
gcc main.c action.c -o main
./main
